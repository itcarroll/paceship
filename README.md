# README

Welcome to our ðŸš€**PACESHIP**, a demonstration and practice repository for the PACE Data Hackweek.

- **DEMONSTRATION**:
  The stages below offer an opinionated process for authoring an open science project that uses Python.
  Click on the version "[tag]" noted in the subsections below to peek into the history of this repository at that stage.
- **PRACTICE**:
  The repository is for real! Not only can you trace the stages of development, you can use the repository to practice sharing your code with fellow hackweek participants.

## Demonstration

This repository is not meant to be a [template repository], nor should you clone it as a way of starting your own project.
Instead, try following these stages from scratch.
You can explore the state of this repository at any stage described below on GitHub (i.e. without needing a local clone) by following the `v0.x` link.

[template repository]: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template

### Stage 1 ([v0.1](../../tree/v0.1))

Create a code repository on GitHub[^1] and start composing a README in your browser.

1. open https://github.com/new (sign in if prompted)
1. enter your project's code name in "**Repository name**"
1. select the option to "**Add a README file**"
1. click the "**Create repository**" button

A README is a special document to all writers of code&mdash;it is the first place to look for information and is the "landing page" for any repository on GitHub.
Use your README to welcome readers and introduce the project.
You can edit this GitHub Flavored Markdown file and create a commit right on the GitHub platform.

[^1]: Or use whatever website works for you and your collaborators! It may be another cloud platform (e.g. https://bitbucket.org/) or a platform hosted by your workplace (e.g. https://git.smce.nasa.gov).

### Stage 2 ([v0.2](../../tree/v0.2))

Start authoring a Jupyter Notebook on the CryoCloud.

1. clone your repository
1. create a `notebooks` folder with a new notebook
1. add a `.gitignore` to prevent "data" from ending up in your code repository

Nearly all projects will have notebooks, and some projects may only have notebooks!
Keeping your notebooks in a subfolder makes your project ready for future complexification, and provides a dedicated area for "data" that are not a good fit for code repositories.

### Stage 3 ([v0.3](../../tree/v0.3))

Change some of your code into functions or classes to allow re-use and improve modularity.
Learn more about "[Defining Your Own Python Function]" Python functions in the Real Python lesson.
Open science projects often don't need classes, unless your project evolves into a package that needs "[The Power of Object-Oriented Programming]".

1. choose part of your notebook that can be "modularized"
1. sort "inputs" into an argument list, providing default values for optional arguments
1. define the function in your "Setup" section, and use it!

### Stage 4 ([v0.4](../../tree/v0.4))

So now you want to use a function of class in multiple notebooks?
The most robust way forward&mdash;this seems like **a big deal** but is not&mdash;is migrating your functions and classes to a proper Python package.
A package is something you can `import` in your notebooks, once it is made visible to the Python interpreter (i.e. "installed").

1. use the `uv` command line tool for initializing the package
    ```shell
    uv init --package
    ```
1. (recommended) delete or gitignore the ".python-version" file
1. move your functions and classes to ".py" files inside the `src` tree
1. use `pip` to perform an "editable" install into your Python interpreter
    ```shell
    pip install -e .
    ```

### Stage 5 ([v0.5](../../tree/v0.5))

Keep track of your dependencies

```shell
uv add numpy pillow
```
```shell
pip install -e .
```

### Stage 6 ([v0.6](../../tree/v0.6))

While Jupyter Notebooks are text-based, they also contain binary outputs and have other drawbacks when it comes to collaboration.
Jupyter Notebooks also make it possible to execute workflows "out of order", leading to problems with reproducibility.
For both of these reasons, replace your Jupyter Notebooks with synchronized Python scripts.

- scripts (uv run)
- notebook 2 (store using fsspec) is move figure to s3 temporary storage

### Stage 7 ([v0.7](../../tree/v0.7))

Prepare for users and contributors!

- CONTRIBUTING.md
- LICENSE
- citation.cff
- zenodo github integration

## Practice

You **should** clone this repository to practice contributing to an open science project.
Like many projects, we include a CONTRIBUTING.md guide to support first-time contributors, so take a look!
